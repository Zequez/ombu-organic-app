## Strategy

We all belong to the same web development firm
We serve others as much as we serve ourselves
We want to create web/apps for individuals and organizations
We create a single repository with all the possible
functionalities that the apps we make can have
We branch the repository for each individual app,
and customize the style, settings and functionalities for
the people that we serve
We gift custom apps to our loved ones and affinity groups
in the hope that we serve them on their mission
We make it all free and open source
We make it all decentralized and on open standards
We make it all performant and accesible

## Random Ideas

- Build a workflow to deploy the static build on IPFS
- Build a workflow to automatically pick certain branches/repos to pull/push/merge changes from
- Build a collection of common static components to build

- Ultimately use blockchain to handle user identity and data
